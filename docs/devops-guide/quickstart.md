This guide helps you  ___host your own Jitsi server___. If you want to have a video conference without setting up any infrastructure, use https://meet.jit.si instead.

This document describes the required steps for a quick Jitsi Meet installation on a Debian-based GNU/Linux system. Debian 10 (Buster) or later, and Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) or later are supported out-of-the-box.

_Note_: Many of the installation steps require elevated privileges. If you are logged in using a regular user account, you may need to temporarily increase your permissions (for example, by using `sudo` for individual commands or `sudo -s` before issuing several commands).

## Required packages and repository updates

On minimal Debian server installs (eg. LXC container), you may already be running as root. You will also need to install `gnupg2` and `sudo` packages.

Make sure your system is up-to-date and required packages are installed:

```sh
# Retrieve the latest package versions across all repositories
sudo apt update

# Ensure support is available for apt repositories served via HTTPS
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
```

On Ubuntu systems, Jitsi requires dependencies from Ubuntu's `universe` package repository.  To ensure this is enabled, run this command:

```sh
sudo apt-add-repository universe

# Retrieve the latest package versions across all repositories
sudo apt update
```

## Basic Jitsi Meet install

### Decide the domain of your server and set up DNS

Decide what domain your server will use. For example, meet.example.org.

Set a DNS A record for that domain, using:
- your server's public IP address, if it has its own public IP; or
- the public IP address of your router, if your server has a private (RFC1918) IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.2) and connects through your router via Network Address Translation (NAT).

### Set up the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (optional)

If the machine used to host the Jitsi Meet instance has a FQDN (for example `meet.example.org`) already set up in DNS, you can set it with the following command:

`sudo hostnamectl set-hostname meet.example.org`

Then add the same FQDN in the `/etc/hosts` file, associating it with the loopback address:

    127.0.0.1 localhost meet.example.org

Finally on the same machine test that you can ping the FQDN with:

`ping "$(hostname)"`

### Add the Jitsi package repository and update the list of available packages

This will modify your Debian or Ubuntu system package sources to make available the Jitsi Meet packages.

```sh
curl https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | sudo sh -c 'gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/jitsi-keyring.gpg'
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jitsi-keyring.gpg] https://download.jitsi.org stable/' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list > /dev/null

# Retrieve the latest package versions across all repositories
sudo apt update
```

### Setup and configure your firewall

The following ports need to be open in your firewall, to allow traffic to the Jitsi Meet server:

* 80 TCP - for SSL certificate verification / renewal with Let's Encrypt
* 443 TCP - for general access to Jitsi Meet
* 10000 UDP - for general network video/audio communications
* 22 TCP - if you access you server using SSH (change the port accordingly if it's not 22)

If you are using `ufw`, you can use the following commands:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 4443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 10000/udp
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

Make sure the firewall status with:

```
sudo ufw status verbose
```

For more details on using and hardening SSH access, see the corresponding [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/SSH) or [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring) documentation.

#### Forward ports via your router

If you are running Jitsi Meet on a server behind NAT, forward the ports on your router to your server's IP address.

_Note_: if participants cannot see or hear each other, double check your firewall / NAT rules.

### Install Jitsi Meet

_Note_: The installer will check if [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) are present (in that order) and configure a virtual host within the web server it finds to serve Jitsi Meet. If none of the above is found it then defaults to Nginx.

If you are already running Nginx on port 443 on the same machine turnserver configuration will be skipped as it will conflict with your current port 443.

```sh
# Perform jitsi-meet installation
sudo apt install jitsi-meet
```
You will be asked about SSL certificate generation. Keep the default answer, "Generate a new self-signed certificate" unless you opt not to use an SSL certificate from LetsEncrypt or if you use other challenge types when validating LetsEncrypt certificates (see below).

You will also be asked to enter the hostname of the Jitsi Meet instance. If you have a [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) for the instance already set up in DNS, enter it there. If you don't have a resolvable hostname, you can enter the IP address of the machine (if it is static or doesn't change).

This hostname (or IP address) will be used for virtualhost configuration inside the Jitsi Meet and also, you and your correspondents will be using it to access the web conferences.

### Generate a Let's Encrypt certificate (optional, recommended)

In order to have encrypted communications, you need a [TLS certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). The easiest way is to use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

_Note_: Jitsi Meet mobile apps *require* a valid certificate signed by a trusted [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) (such as a Let's Encrypt certificate) and will not be able to connect to your server if you choose a self-signed certificate.

Simply run the following in your shell:

```sh
sudo /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh
```
Note that this script uses the [HTTP-01 challenge type](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/) and thus your instance needs to be accessible from the public internet on both ports 80 and 443. If you want to use a different challenge type, don't use this script and instead choose ___I want to use my own certificate___ during `jitsi-meet` installation.

#### Advanced configuration

If the installation is on a machine [behind NAT](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/faq.md) jitsi-videobridge should configure itself automatically on boot. If three way call does not work further configuration of jitsi-videobridge is needed in order for it to be accessible from outside.

Provided that all required ports are routed (forwarded) to the machine that it runs on. By default these ports are (TCP/443 or TCP/4443 and UDP/10000).

The following extra lines need to be added to the file `/etc/jitsi/videobridge/sip-communicator.properties`:

```
org.ice4j.ice.harvest.NAT_HARVESTER_LOCAL_ADDRESS=<Local.IP.Address>
org.ice4j.ice.harvest.NAT_HARVESTER_PUBLIC_ADDRESS=<Public.IP.Address>
```

And comment the existing `org.ice4j.ice.harvest.STUN_MAPPING_HARVESTER_ADDRESSES`.

See [the documentation of ice4j](https://github.com/jitsi/ice4j/blob/master/doc/configuration.md)
for details.

If the installation is behind a proxying nginx server, remove `/etc/nginx/modules-enabled/60-jitsi-meet.conf`. Then go to `/etc/nginx/site-available/your-conf` and change it to listen on 443 instead of 4444 and restart nginx.

Default deployments on systems using systemd will have low default values for maximum processes and open files. If the used bridge will expect higher number of participants the default values need to be adjusted (the default values are good for less than 100 participants).

To update the values edit `/etc/systemd/system.conf` and make sure you have the following values if values are smaller, if not do not update.

```
DefaultLimitNOFILE=65000
DefaultLimitNPROC=65000
DefaultTasksMax=65000
```

To check values just run:

```
systemctl show --property DefaultLimitNPROC
systemctl show --property DefaultLimitNOFILE
systemctl show --property DefaultTasksMax
```

To load the values and check them look [here](#systemd-details) for details.

_Note_: By default, anyone who has access to your jitsi instance will be able to start a conference: if your server is open to the world, anyone can have a chat with anyone else. If you want to limit the ability to start a conference to registered users, set up a "secure domain". Follow the instructions at https://github.com/jitsi/jicofo#secure-domain.

### Confirm that your installation is working

Launch a web browser (Chrome, Chromium or latest Opera) and enter the hostname or IP address from the previous step into the address bar.

If you used a self-signed certificate (as opposed to using Let's Encrypt), your web browser will ask you to confirm that you trust the certificate. If you are testing from the iOS or Android app, it will probably fail at this point, if you are using a self-signed certificate.

You should see a web page prompting you to create a new meeting.  Make sure that you can successfully create a meeting and that other participants are able to join the session.

If this all worked, then congratulations!  You have an operational Jitsi conference service.

## Adding sip-gateway to Jitsi Meet

### Install Jigasi

Jigasi is a server-side application acting as a gateway to Jitsi Meet conferences. It allows regular [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) clients to join meetings and provides transcription capabilities.

```sh
sudo apt install jigasi
```

During the installation, you will be asked to enter your SIP account and password. This account will be used to invite the other SIP participants.

### Reload Jitsi Meet

Launch again a browser with the Jitsi Meet URL and you'll see a telephone icon on the right end of the toolbar. Use it to invite SIP accounts to join the current conference.

Enjoy!

## Uninstall

```sh
sudo apt purge jigasi jitsi-meet jitsi-meet-web-config jitsi-meet-prosody jitsi-meet-turnserver jitsi-meet-web jicofo jitsi-videobridge2
```

Sometimes the following packages will fail to uninstall properly:

- jigasi
- jitsi-videobridge

When this happens, just run the uninstall command a second time and it should be ok.

The reason for the failure is that sometimes the uninstall script is faster than the process that stops the daemons. The second run of the uninstall command fixes this, as by then the jigasi or jitsi-videobridge daemons are already stopped.

#### Systemd details
To reload the systemd changes on a running system execute `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` and `sudo systemctl restart jitsi-videobridge2`.
To check the tasks part execute `sudo systemctl status jitsi-videobridge2` and you should see `Tasks: XX (limit: 65000)`.
To check the files and process part execute ```cat /proc/`cat /var/run/jitsi-videobridge/jitsi-videobridge.pid`/limits``` and you should see:
```
Max processes             65000                65000                processes
Max open files            65000                65000                files
```

## Debugging problems

If you run into problems, one thing to try is using a different web browser. Some versions of some browsers are known to have issues with Jitsi Meet. You can also visit https://test.webrtc.org to test your browser's [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC) support.

Another place to look is the various log files:

```
/var/log/jitsi/jvb.log
/var/log/jitsi/jicofo.log
/var/log/prosody/prosody.log
```
