The `JitsiMeetExternalAPI` object implements the [EventEmitter] API for emitting and listening for events.

You can add event listeners to the embedded Jitsi Meet using the **`addListener`** method:

```javascript
api.addListener(event, listener);
```

If you want to remove a listener you can use the **`removeListener`** method:

```javascript
api.removeListener(event, listener);
```

The **`event`** parameter is a string object with the name of the event.

The **`listener`** parameter is a function object with one argument that creates a notification when the event occurs along with related event data.

The following events are currently supported:
