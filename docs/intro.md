All of this wrapped in a friendly interface and without forgetting your security.

## How to read the Handbook

The content is divided in self descriptive sections. Depending of your needs you should start exploring the parts you feel will help you the most. But just in case you don't know where to start, here's a clue of what each topic is about. 

* [The User guide](user-guide/user-guide.md). Designed for helping users to better
understand all the available features and how to use them. If you are just arriving to the Jitsi party and want to have a feel of what is capable of, this is a good place to start reading.

* [Developer guide](dev-guide/dev-guide.md): Everything you need to know if you want to integrate the Jitsi Meet API / SDK in one of your products or if you're planing to contribute to some of the Jitsi projects by developing new features or fixing bugs.

* [Self-Hosting guide](devops-guide/devops-guide.md): The place for folks wanting to self-host their own Jitsi service. If you are a system administrator who wants to learn how to deploy, operate and scale Jitsi properly, this is the section you must check out first. 

Anyway... if all of this sounds interesting to you and you just can't decide. Keep reading next section!
