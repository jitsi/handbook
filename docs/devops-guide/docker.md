:::note
Starting with release `stable-7289-1` our images are provided with `amd64` and `arm64` architecture.
:::

## Quick start

In order to quickly run Jitsi Meet on a machine running Docker and Docker Compose,
follow these steps:

1. Download and extract the [latest release]. **DO NOT** clone the git repository. See below if you are interested in running test images.
    
2. Create a ``.env`` file by copying and adjusting ``env.example``:
   
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
3. Set strong passwords in the security section options of ``.env`` file by running the following bash script
   
   ```bash
   ./gen-passwords.sh
   ```
   
4. Create required `CONFIG` directories
   * For linux: 
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.jitsi-meet-cfg/{web,transcripts,prosody/config,prosody/prosody-plugins-custom,jicofo,jvb,jigasi,jibri}
   ```
   * For Windows: 
   ```bash
   echo web,transcripts,prosody/config,prosody/prosody-plugins-custom,jicofo,jvb,jigasi,jibri | % { mkdir "~/.jitsi-meet-cfg/$_" }
   ```
5. Run ``docker-compose up -d``
6. Access the web UI at [``https://localhost:8443``](https://localhost:8443) (or a different port, in case you edited the `.env` file).

:::note
HTTP (not HTTPS) is also available (on port 8000, by default), but that's e.g. for a reverse proxy setup;
direct access via HTTP instead HTTPS leads to WebRTC errors such as
_Failed to access your microphone/camera: Cannot use microphone/camera for an unknown reason. Cannot read property 'getUserMedia' of undefined_
or _navigator.mediaDevices is undefined_.
:::

If you want to use jigasi too, first configure your env file with SIP credentials
and then run Docker Compose as follows: 

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f jigasi.yml up
```

If you want to enable document sharing via [Etherpad],
configure it and run Docker Compose as follows: 

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f etherpad.yml up
```

If you want to use jibri too, first configure a host as described in JItsi BRoadcasting Infrastructure configuration section
and then run Docker Compose as follows:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f jibri.yml up -d
```

or to use jigasi too:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f jigasi.yml -f jibri.yml up -d
```

### Testing development / unstable builds

Download the latest code:
     
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet && cd docker-jitsi-meet
```

:::note
The code in `master` is designed to work with the unstable images. Do not run it with release images.
:::

Run `docker-compose up` as usual.

Every day a new "unstable" image build is uploaded.

### Building your own images

Download the latest code:
     
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet && cd docker-jitsi-meet
```

The provided `Makefile` provides a comprehensive way of building the whole stack or individual images.

To build all images:

```bash
make
```

To build a specific image (the web image for example):

```bash
make build_web
```

Once your local build is ready make sure to add `JITSI_IMAGE_VERSION=latest` to your `.env` file.

### Security note

This setup used to have default passwords for internal accounts used across components.
In order to make the default setup secure by default these have been removed and the respective containers won't start without having a password set.

Strong passwords may be generated as follows: `./gen-passwords.sh`
This will modify your `.env` file (a backup is saved in `.env.bak`) and set strong passwords for each of the
required options. Passwords are generated using `openssl rand -hex 16` .

DO NOT reuse any of the passwords.

## Architecture

A Jitsi Meet installation can be broken down into the following components:

* A web interface
* An XMPP server
* A conference focus component
* A video router (could be more than one)
* A SIP gateway for audio calls
* A Broadcasting Infrastructure for recording or streaming a conference.

![](../assets/docker-jitsi-meet.png)

The diagram shows a typical deployment in a host running Docker. This project
separates each of the components above into interlinked containers. To this end,
several container images are provided.

### External Ports

The following external ports must be opened on a firewall:

* `80/tcp` for Web UI HTTP (really just to redirect, after uncommenting `ENABLE_HTTP_REDIRECT=1` in `.env`)
* `443/tcp` for Web UI HTTPS
* `4443/tcp` for RTP media over TCP
* `10000/udp` for RTP media over UDP

Also `20000-20050/udp` for jigasi, in case you choose to deploy that to facilitate SIP access.

E.g. on a CentOS/Fedora server this would be done like this (without SIP access):

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=4443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=10000/udp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

See [the corresponding section in the manual setup guide](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-quickstart#setup-and-configure-your-firewall).

### Images

* **base**: Debian stable base image with the [S6 Overlay] for process control and the
  [Jitsi repositories] enabled. All other images are based on this one.
* **base-java**: Same as the above, plus Java (OpenJDK).
* **web**: Jitsi Meet web UI, served with nginx.
* **prosody**: [Prosody], the XMPP server.
* **jicofo**: [Jicofo], the XMPP focus component.
* **jvb**: [Jitsi Videobridge], the video router.
* **jigasi**: [Jigasi], the SIP (audio only) gateway.
* **jibri**: [Jibri], the broadcasting infrastructure.

### Design considerations

Jitsi Meet uses XMPP for signaling, thus the need for the XMPP server.
The setup provided by these containers does not expose the XMPP server to the outside world.
Instead, it's kept completely sealed, and routing of XMPP traffic only happens on a user-defined network.

The XMPP server can be exposed to the outside world,
but that's out of the scope of this project.

## Configuration

The configuration is performed via environment variables contained in a ``.env`` file.
You can copy the provided ``env.example`` file as a reference.

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`CONFIG` | Directory where all configuration will be stored | /opt/jitsi-meet-cfg
`TZ` | System Time Zone | Europe/Amsterdam
`HTTP_PORT` | Exposed port for HTTP traffic | 8000
`HTTPS_PORT` | Exposed port for HTTPS traffic | 8443
`DOCKER_HOST_ADDRESS` | IP address of the Docker host, needed for LAN environments | 192.168.1.1
`PUBLIC_URL` | Public URL for the web service | https://meet.example.com

:::note
The mobile apps won't work with self-signed certificates (the default).
See below for instructions on how to obtain a proper certificate with Let's Encrypt.
:::

### TLS Configuration

#### Let's Encrypt configuration

If you want to expose your Jitsi Meet instance to the outside traffic directly, but don't own a proper TLS certificate, you are in luck 
because Let's Encrypt support is built right in. Here are the required options:

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`ENABLE_LETSENCRYPT` | Enable Let's Encrypt certificate generation | 1
`LETSENCRYPT_DOMAIN` | Domain for which to generate the certificate | meet.example.com
`LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` | E-Mail for receiving important account notifications (mandatory) | alice@atlanta.net

In addition, you will need to set `HTTP_PORT` to 80 and `HTTPS_PORT` to 443 and PUBLIC_URL to your domain.
You might also consider to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS by setting `ENABLE_HTTP_REDIRECT=1`.

**Let's Encrypt rate limit warning**: Let's Encrypt has a limit to how many times you can submit a request
for a new certificate for your domain name. At the time of writing, the current limit is five new (duplicate) 
certificates for the same domain name every seven days. Because of this, it is recommended that you disable the 
Let's Encrypt enviroment variables from `.env` if you plan on deleting the `.jitsi-meet-cfg` folder.
Otherwise, you might want to consider moving the `.jitsi-meet-cfg` folder to a different location so you have a safe place to find
the certificate that already Let's Encrypt issued. Or do initial testing with Let's Encrypt disabled, then re-enable
Let's Encrypt once you are done testing.

:::note
When you move away from `LETSENCRYPT_USE_STAGING`,
you will have to manually clear the certificates from `.jitsi-meet-cfg/web`.
:::

For more information on Let's Encrypt's rate limits, visit:
https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/

#### Using existing TLS certificate and key

If you own a proper TLS certificate and don't need a Let's Encrypt certificate, you can configure Jitsi Meet container 
to use it. 

Unlike Let's Encrypt certificates, this is not configured through the `.env`file, but by telling Jitsi Meet's `web` service 
to mount the following two volumes: 

- mount `/path/to/your/cert.key` file to `/config/keys/cert.key` mount point
- mount `/path/to/your/cert.fullchain` file to the `/config/keys/cert.crt` mount point.

Doing it in `docker-compose.yml` file should look like this:


```
services:
    web:
        ...
        volumes:
            ...
            - /path/to/your/cert.fullchain:/config/keys/cert.crt
            - /path/to/your/cert.key:/config/keys/cert.key
```

### Features configuration (config.js)

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`TOOLBAR_BUTTONS` | Configure toolbar buttons. Add the buttons name separated with comma(no spaces between comma) | |
`HIDE_PREMEETING_BUTTONS` | Hide the buttons at pre-join screen. Add the buttons name separated with comma | |
`ENABLE_LOBBY` | Control whether the lobby feature should be enabled or not | 1
`ENABLE_AV_MODERATION` | Control whether the A/V moderation should be enabled or not | 1
`ENABLE_PREJOIN_PAGE` | Show a prejoin page before entering a conference | 1
`ENABLE_WELCOME_PAGE` | Enable the welcome page | 1
`ENABLE_CLOSE_PAGE` | Enable the close page | 0
`DISABLE_AUDIO_LEVELS` | Disable measuring of audio levels | 0
`ENABLE_NOISY_MIC_DETECTION` | Enable noisy mic detection | 1
`ENABLE_BREAKOUT_ROOMS` | Enable breakout rooms | 1

### Jigasi SIP gateway (audio only) configuration

If you want to enable the SIP gateway, these options are required:

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`JIGASI_SIP_URI` | SIP URI for incoming / outgoing calls | test@sip2sip.info
`JIGASI_SIP_PASSWORD` | Password for the specified SIP account | `<unset>`
`JIGASI_SIP_SERVER` | SIP server (use the SIP account domain if in doubt) | sip2sip.info
`JIGASI_SIP_PORT` | SIP server port | 5060
`JIGASI_SIP_TRANSPORT` | SIP transport | UDP

#### Display Dial-In information

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`DIALIN_NUMBERS_URL` | URL to the JSON with all Dial-In numbers | https://meet.example.com/dialin.json
`CONFCODE_URL` | URL to the API for checking/generating Dial-In codes | https://jitsi-api.jitsi.net/conferenceMapper

The JSON with the Dial-In numbers should look like this:
```json
{"message":"Dial-In numbers:","numbers":{"DE": ["+49-721-0000-0000"]},"numbersEnabled":true}
```

### Recording / live streaming configuration

Before running Jibri, you need to set up an ALSA loopback device on the host. This **will not**
work on a non-Linux host.

For CentOS 7, the module is already compiled with the kernel, so just run:

```bash
# configure 5 capture/playback interfaces
echo "options snd-aloop enable=1,1,1,1,1 index=0,1,2,3,4" > /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-loopback.conf
# setup autoload the module
echo "snd_aloop" > /etc/modules-load.d/snd_aloop.conf
# load the module
modprobe snd-aloop
# check that the module is loaded
lsmod | grep snd_aloop
```

For Ubuntu:

```bash
# install the module
apt update && apt install linux-image-extra-virtual
# configure 5 capture/playback interfaces
echo "options snd-aloop enable=1,1,1,1,1 index=0,1,2,3,4" > /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-loopback.conf
# setup autoload the module
echo "snd-aloop" >> /etc/modules
# check that the module is loaded
lsmod | grep snd_aloop
```

:::note
If you are running on AWS you may need to reboot your machine to use the generic kernel instead
of the "aws" kernel. If after reboot, your machine is still using the "aws" kernel, you'll need to manually update the grub file. So just run:
:::

```bash
# open the grub file in editor
nano /etc/default/grub
# Modify the value of GRUB_DEFAULT from "0" to "1>2"
# Save and exit from file

# Update grub
update-grub
# Reboot the machine
reboot now
```

If you want to enable Jibri these options are required:

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`ENABLE_RECORDING` | Enable recording / live streaming | 1

Extended Jibri configuration:

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`JIBRI_RECORDER_USER` | Internal recorder user for Jibri client connections | recorder
`JIBRI_RECORDER_PASSWORD` | Internal recorder password for Jibri client connections | `<unset>`
`JIBRI_RECORDING_DIR` | Directory for recordings inside Jibri container | /config/recordings
`JIBRI_FINALIZE_RECORDING_SCRIPT_PATH` | The finalizing script. Will run after recording is complete | /config/finalize.sh
`JIBRI_XMPP_USER` | Internal user for Jibri client connections. | jibri
`JIBRI_STRIP_DOMAIN_JID` | Prefix domain for strip inside Jibri (please see env.example for details) | muc
`JIBRI_BREWERY_MUC` | MUC name for the Jibri pool | jibribrewery
`JIBRI_PENDING_TIMEOUT` | MUC connection timeout | 90
`JIBRI_LOGS_DIR` | Directory for logs inside Jibri container | /config/logs

For using multiple Jibri instances, you have to select different loopback interfaces for each instance manually.

<details>
  <summary>Set interface in file `/home/jibri/.asoundrc` inside a docker container.</summary>

  Default the first instance has:

  ```
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,0,0"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,0,1"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,1,1"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,1,0"
  ...
  ```

  To setup the second instance, run container with changed `/home/jibri/.asoundrc`:

  ```
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback_1,0,0"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback_1,0,1"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback_1,1,1"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback_1,1,0"
  ...
  ```

  Also you can use numbering id for set loopback interface. The third instance will have `.asoundrc` that looks like:

  ```
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:2,0,0"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:2,0,1"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:2,1,1"
  ...
  slave.pcm "hw:2,1,0"
  ...

  ```

</details>

### Jitsi Meet configuration

:::tip This section partly contains duplicate settings

There are settings within your ``docker-compose.yml`` like ``START_AUDIO_MUTED``
that will be overwritten if you follow the below guide.

:::

Jitsi-Meet uses two configuration files for changing default settings within
the web interface: ``config.js`` and ``interface_config.js``. The files are
located within the ``CONFIG`` directory configured within your environment file.

These files are re-created on every container restart. 
If you'd like to provide your own settings, create your own config files:
``custom-config.js`` and ``custom-interface_config.js``.

It's enough to provide your relevant settings only, the docker scripts will 
append your custom files to the default ones!

### Authentication

Authentication can be controlled with the environment variables below. If guest
access is enabled, unauthenticated users will need to wait until a user authenticates
before they can join a room. If guest access is not enabled, every user will need
to authenticate before they can join.

If authentication is enabled, once an authenticated user logged in, it is always logged in before the session timeout.You can set `ENABLE_AUTO_LOGIN=0` to disable this default auto login feature.

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`ENABLE_AUTH` | Enable authentication | 1
`ENABLE_GUESTS` | Enable guest access | 1
`AUTH_TYPE` | Select authentication type (internal, jwt or ldap) | internal
`ENABLE_AUTO_LOGIN` | Enable auto login  | 1

#### Internal authentication

The default authentication mode (`internal`) uses XMPP credentials to authenticate users.
To enable it you have to enable authentication with `ENABLE_AUTH` and set `AUTH_TYPE` to `internal`,
then configure the settings you can see below.

Internal users must be created with the ``prosodyctl`` utility in the ``prosody`` container.
In order to do that, first, execute a shell in the corresponding container:

```bash
docker-compose exec prosody /bin/bash
```

Once in the container, run the following command to create a user:

```bash
prosodyctl --config /config/prosody.cfg.lua register TheDesiredUsername meet.jitsi TheDesiredPassword
```

Note that the command produces no output.

To delete a user, run the following command in the container:

```bash
prosodyctl --config /config/prosody.cfg.lua unregister TheDesiredUsername meet.jitsi
```

To list all users, run the following command in the container:

```bash
find /config/data/meet%2ejitsi/accounts -type f -exec basename {} .dat \;
```

#### Authentication using LDAP

You can use LDAP to authenticate users. To enable it you have to enable authentication with `ENABLE_AUTH` and
set `AUTH_TYPE` to `ldap`, then configure the settings you can see below.

`LDAP_TLS_CACERT_DIR` | Path to CA certs directory. Used when server certificate verification is enabled. | /etc/ssl/certs
`LDAP_START_TLS` | Enable START_TLS, requires LDAPv3, URL must be ldap:// not ldaps:// | 0

#### Authentication using JWT tokens

You can use JWT tokens to authenticate users. To enable it you have to enable authentication with `ENABLE_AUTH` and
set `AUTH_TYPE` to `jwt`, then configure the settings you can see below.

Variable | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`JWT_APP_ID` | Application identifier | my_jitsi_app_id
`JWT_APP_SECRET` | Application secret known only to your token | my_jitsi_app_secret
`JWT_ACCEPTED_ISSUERS` | (Optional) Set asap_accepted_issuers as a comma separated list | my_web_client,my_app_client

`JWT_AUTH_TYPE` | (Optional) Controls which module is used for processing incoming JWTs | token
`JWT_TOKEN_AUTH_MODULE` | (Optional) Controls which module is used for validating JWTs | token_verification

This can be tested using the [jwt.io] debugger. Use the following sample payload:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "user": {
      "avatar": "https://robohash.org/john-doe",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "jdoe@example.com"
    }
  },
  "aud": "my_jitsi_app_id",
  "iss": "my_jitsi_app_id",
  "sub": "meet.jitsi",

### Running behind NAT or on a LAN environment

If running in a LAN environment (as well as on the public Internet, via NAT) is a requirement,
the ``DOCKER_HOST_ADDRESS`` should be set. This way, the Videobridge will advertise the IP address
of the host running Docker instead of the internal IP address that Docker assigned it, thus making [ICE]
succeed. If your users are coming in over the Internet (and not over LAN), this will likely be your public IP address. If this is not set up correctly, calls will crash when more than two users join a meeting.

The public IP address is discovered via [STUN].
STUN servers can be specified with the ``JVB_STUN_SERVERS`` option.

:::note
Due to a bug in the docker version currently in the Debian repos (20.10.5), [Docker does not listen on IPv6 ports](https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-doesnt-open-ipv6-ports/106201/2), so for that combination you will have to [manually obtain the latest version](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/).

## Accessing server logs

The default bahavior of `docker-jitsi-meet` is to log to `stdout`.

While the logs are sent to `stdout`, they are not lost: unless configured to drop all logs, Docker keeps them available for future retrieval and processing.

If you need to access the container's logs you have multiple options. Here are the main ones:

* run `docker-compose logs -t -f <service_name>` from command line, where `<service_name>` is one of `web`, `prosody`,`jvb`, `jicofo`. This command will output the logs for the selected service to stdout with timestamps.
* use a standard [docker logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/) to redirect the logs to the desired target (for instance `syslog` or `splunk`).
* serach [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=) for a third party [docker logging driver plugin](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/plugins/) 
* or [write your own driver plugin](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_logging/) if you have a very specific need.

For instance, if you want to have all logs related to a `<service_name>` written to `/var/log/jitsi/<service_name>` as `json` output, you could use [docker-file-log-driver](https://github.com/deep-compute/docker-file-log-driver) and configure it by adding the following block in your `docker-compose.yml` file, at the same level as the `image` block of the selected `<service_name>`:

```
services:
    <service_name>:
        image: ...
        ...
        logging:
            driver: file-log-driver
            options:
                fpath: "/jitsi/<service_name>.log"
```

If you want to only display the `message` part of the log in `json` format, simply execute the following command (for instance if `fpath` was set to `/jitsi/jvb.log`) which uses `jq` to extract the relevant part of the logs:


```
sudo cat /var/log/jitsi/jvb.log | jq -r '.msg' | jq -r '.message'
```

## Build Instructions

Building your images allows you to edit the configuration files of each image individually, providing more customization for your deployment.

The docker images can be built by running the `make` command in the main repository folder. If you need to overwrite existing images from the remote source, use `FORCE_REBUILD=1 make`.

If you are on the unstable branch, build the images with `FORCE_REBUILD=1 JITSI_RELEASE=unstable make`.

You are now able to run `docker-compose up` as usual.

## Running behind a reverse proxy

By default this setup is using WebSocket connections for 2 core components:

* Signalling (XMPP)
* Bridge channel (colibri)

Due to the hop-by-hop nature of WebSockets the reverse proxy must properly terminate and forward WebSocket connections. There 2 routes require such treatment:

* /xmpp-websocket
* /colibri-ws

With nginx, these routes can be forwarded using the following config snippet:

```
location /xmpp-websocket {
    proxy_pass https://localhost:8443;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
location /colibri-ws {
    proxy_pass https://localhost:8443;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
```
With apache, `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_wstunnel` need to be enabled and these routes can be forwarded using the following config snippet:

```
<IfModule mod_proxy.c>
    <IfModule mod_proxy_wstunnel.c>
        ProxyTimeout 900
        <Location "/xmpp-websocket">
            ProxyPass "wss://localhost:8443/xmpp-websocket"
        </Location>
        <Location "/colibri-ws/">
            ProxyPass "wss://localhost:8443/colibri-ws/"
        </Location>
    </IfModule>
</IfModule>

```

where `https://localhost:8443/` is the url of the web service's ingress.

### Disabling WebSocket connections

:::note
This is not the recommended setup.
:::

If using WebSockets is not an option, these environment variables can be set to fallback to HTTP polling and WebRTC datachannels:

```bash
ENABLE_SCTP=1
ENABLE_COLIBRI_WEBSOCKET=0
ENABLE_XMPP_WEBSOCKET=0
