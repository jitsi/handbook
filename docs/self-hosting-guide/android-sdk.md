The Jitsi Meet Android SDK provides the same user experience as the Jitsi Meet app,
in a customizable way which you can embed in your apps.

:::important
Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher is required.
:::

## Sample applications using the SDK

If you want to see how easy integrating the Jitsi Meet SDK into a native application is, take a look at the
[sample applications repository](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-sdk-samples).

## Build your own, or use a pre-build SDK artifacts/binaries

Jitsi conveniently provides a pre-build SDK artifacts/binaries in its Maven repository. When you do not require any
modification to the SDK itself or any of its dependencies, it's suggested to use the pre-build SDK. This avoids the
complexity of building and installing your own SDK artifacts/binaries.

### Use pre-build SDK artifacts/binaries

In your project, add the Maven repository
`https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-maven-repository/raw/master/releases` and the
dependency `org.jitsi.react:jitsi-meet-sdk` into your `build.gradle` files.

The repository typically goes into the `build.gradle` file in the root of your project:

```gradle title="build.gradle"
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-maven-repository/raw/master/releases"
        }
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

In recent versions of Android Studios, `allprojects{}` might not be found in `build.gradle`. In that case, the repository goes into the `settings.gradle` file in the root of your project:

```gradle title="settings.gradle"
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url "https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-maven-repository/raw/master/releases"
        }
        maven {
            url "https://maven.google.com"
        }
    }
}
```

Dependency definitions belong in the individual module `build.gradle` files:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // (other dependencies)
    implementation ('org.jitsi.react:jitsi-meet-sdk:+') { transitive = true }
}
```

:::warning
Make sure you pin your dependency by checking the [releases page](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-release-notes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-MOBILE-SDKS.md).
:::

### Build and use your own SDK artifacts/binaries

<details>
<summary>Show building instructions</summary>

Start by making sure that your development environment [is set up correctly](mobile.md).

:::note A Note on Dependencies
Apart from the SDK, Jitsi also publishes a binary Maven artifact for some of the SDK dependencies (that are not otherwise publicly available) to the Jitsi Maven repository. When you're planning to use a SDK that is built from source, you'll likely use a version of the source code that is newer (or at least _different_) than the version of the source that was used to create the binary SDK artifact. As a consequence, the dependencies that your project will need, might also be different from those that are published in the Jitsi Maven repository. This might lead to build problems, caused by dependencies that are unavailable.
:::

If you want to use a SDK that is built from source, you will likely benefit from composing a local Maven repository that contains these dependencies. The text below describes how you create a repository that includes both the SDK as well as these dependencies. For illustration purposes, we'll define the location of this local Maven repository as `/tmp/repo`

In source code form, the Android SDK dependencies are locked/pinned by `package.json` and `package-lock.json` of the Jitsi Meet project. To obtain the data, execute NPM in the jitsi-meet project directory:

    npm install

This will pull in the dependencies in either binary format, or in source code format, somewhere under /node_modules/

Third-party React Native _modules_, which Jitsi Meet SDK for Android depends on, are download by NPM in source code 
or binary form. These need to be assembled into Maven artifacts, and then published to your local Maven repository.
A script is provided to facilitate this. From the root of the jitsi-meet project repository, run:

    ./android/scripts/release-sdk.sh /tmp/repo

This will build and publish the SDK, and all of its dependencies to the specified Maven repository (`/tmp/repo`) in
this example.

You're now ready to use the artifacts. In _your_ project, add the Maven repository that you used above (`/tmp/repo`) into your top-level `build.gradle` file:

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            maven { url "file:/tmp/repo" }
            google()
            mavenCentral()
            maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
        }
    }

You can use your local repository to replace the Jitsi repository (`maven { url "https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-maven-repository/raw/master/releases" }`) when you published _all_ subprojects. If you didn't do that, you'll have to add both repositories. Make sure your local repository is listed first!

Then, define the dependency `org.jitsi.react:jitsi-meet-sdk` into the `build.gradle` file of your module:

    implementation ('org.jitsi.react:jitsi-meet-sdk:+') { transitive = true }

Note that there should not be a need to explicitly add the other dependencies, as they will be pulled in as transitive
dependencies of `jitsi-meet-sdk`.

</details>

## Using the API

Jitsi Meet SDK is an Android library which embodies the whole Jitsi Meet
experience and makes it reusable by third-party apps.

First, add Java 1.8 compatibility support to your project by adding the
following lines into your `build.gradle` file:

```
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

To get started, just launch `JitsiMeetActivity` pointing to the room you want:

```java
// Somewhere early in your app.
JitsiMeetConferenceOptions defaultOptions
        = new JitsiMeetConferenceOptions.Builder()
    .setServerURL(serverURL)
    // When using JaaS, set the obtained JWT here
    //.setToken("MyJWT")
    // Different features flags can be set
    // .setFeatureFlag("toolbox.enabled", false)
    // .setFeatureFlag("filmstrip.enabled", false)
    .setFeatureFlag("welcomepage.enabled", false)
    .build();
JitsiMeet.setDefaultConferenceOptions(defaultOptions);
// ...
// Build options object for joining the conference. The SDK will merge the default
// one we set earlier and this one when joining.
JitsiMeetConferenceOptions options
        = new JitsiMeetConferenceOptions.Builder()
    .setRoom(roomName)
    // Settings for audio and video
    //.setAudioMuted(true)
    //.setVideoMuted(true)
    .build();
// Launch the new activity with the given options. The launch() method takes care
// of creating the required Intent and passing the options.
JitsiMeetActivity.launch(this, options);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `org.jitsi.meet.sdk.JitsiMeetView` class which
extends `android.view.View`.

Note that this should only be needed when `JitsiMeetActivity` cannot be used for
some reason. Extending `JitsiMeetView` requires manual wiring of the view to
the activity, using a lot of boilerplate code. Using the Activity instead of the
View is strongly recommended.

<details>
<summary>Show example</summary>

```java
package org.jitsi.example;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity;

import org.jitsi.meet.sdk.JitsiMeetView;
import org.jitsi.meet.sdk.ReactActivityLifecycleCallbacks;

// Example
//
public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity implements JitsiMeetActivityInterface {
    private JitsiMeetView view;

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(
            int requestCode,
            int resultCode,
            Intent data) {
        JitsiMeetActivityDelegate.onActivityResult(
                this, requestCode, resultCode, data);
    }

    @Override
    public void onBackPressed() {
        JitsiMeetActivityDelegate.onBackPressed();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        view = new JitsiMeetView(this);
        JitsiMeetConferenceOptions options = new JitsiMeetConferenceOptions.Builder()
            .setRoom("https://meet.jit.si/test123")
            .build();
        view.join(options);

        setContentView(view);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();

        view.dispose();
        view = null;

        JitsiMeetActivityDelegate.onHostDestroy(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
        JitsiMeetActivityDelegate.onNewIntent(intent);
    }

    @Override
    public void onRequestPermissionsResult(
            final int requestCode,
            final String[] permissions,
            final int[] grantResults) {
        JitsiMeetActivityDelegate.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();

        JitsiMeetActivityDelegate.onHostResume(this);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();

        JitsiMeetActivityDelegate.onHostPause(this);
    }
}
```

</details>

### JitsiMeetActivity

This class encapsulates a high level API in the form of an Android `FragmentActivity`
which displays a single `JitsiMeetView`. You can pass a URL as a `ACTION_VIEW`
on the Intent when starting it and it will join the conference, and will be
automatically terminated (finish() will be called on the activity) when the
conference ends or fails.

### JitsiMeetView

The `JitsiMeetView` class is the core of Jitsi Meet SDK. It's designed to
display a Jitsi Meet conference (or a welcome page).

#### join(options)

Joins the conference specified by the given `JitsiMeetConferenceOptions`.

#### dispose()

Releases all resources associated with this view. This method MUST be called
when the Activity holding this view is going to be destroyed, usually in the
`onDestroy()` method.

### JitsiMeetConferenceOptions

This object encapsulates all the options that can be tweaked when joining
a conference.

Example:

```java
JitsiMeetConferenceOptions options = new JitsiMeetConferenceOptions.Builder()
    .setServerURL(new URL("https://meet.jit.si"))
    .setRoom("test123")
    .setAudioMuted(false)
    .setVideoMuted(false)
    .setAudioOnly(false)
    .setWelcomePageEnabled(false)
    .setConfigOverride("requireDisplayName", true)
    .build();
```

See the `JitsiMeetConferenceOptions` implementation for all available options.

### JitsiMeetActivityDelegate

This class handles the interaction between `JitsiMeetView` and its enclosing
`Activity`. Generally this shouldn't be consumed by users, because they'd be
using `JitsiMeetActivity` instead, which is already completely integrated.

All its methods are static.

#### onActivityResult(...)

Helper method to handle results of auxiliary activities launched by the SDK.
Should be called from the activity method of the same name.

#### onBackPressed()

Helper method which should be called from the activity's `onBackPressed` method.
If this function returns `true`, it means the action was handled and thus no
extra processing is required; otherwise the app should call the parent's
`onBackPressed` method.

#### onHostDestroy(...)

Helper method which should be called from the activity's `onDestroy` method.

#### onHostResume(...)

Helper method which should be called from the activity's `onResume` or `onStop`
method.

#### onHostStop(...)

Helper method which should be called from the activity's `onSstop` method.

#### onNewIntent(...)

Helper method for integrating the *deep linking* functionality. If your app's
activity is launched in "singleTask" mode this method should be called from the
activity's `onNewIntent` method.

#### onRequestPermissionsResult(...)

Helper method to handle permission requests inside the SDK. It should be called
from the activity method of the same name.

#### onUserLeaveHint()

Helper method for integrating automatic Picture-in-Picture. It should be called
from the activity's `onUserLeaveHint` method.

This is a static method.

### Listening for broadcasted events

The SDK broadcasts several events that the users can listen for.

```java
    IntentFilter intentFilter = new IntentFilter();
    intentFilter.addAction(BroadcastEvent.Type.CONFERENCE_JOINED.getAction());
    LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).registerReceiver(broadcastReceiver, intentFilter);
 ```  
        
Please see `JitsiMeetActivity`, which registers for all the events and can serve as an example.

#### Supported events

##### CONFERENCE_JOINED

Broadcasted when a conference was joined. `data` contains the following information:

- `url`: the conference URL

##### CONFERENCE_TERMINATED

Broadcasted when the active conference ends, be it because of user choice or because of a failure. `data` contains the
following information:

- `url`: the conference URL
- `error`: missing if the conference finished gracefully, otherwise contains the error message

##### CONFERENCE_WILL_JOIN

Broadcasted before a conference is joined. `data` contains the following information:

- `url`: the conference URL

##### AUDIO_MUTED_CHANGED

Broadcasted when the local participant's audio is muted or unmuted. `data` contains the following information:

- `muted`: a boolean indicating whether the audio is muted or not.

##### PARTICIPANT_JOINED

Broadcasted when a participant has joined the conference. `data` contains the following information:

- `email`: the email of the participant. It may not be set if the remote participant didn't set one.
- `name`: the name of the participant.
- `role`: the role of the participant.
- `participantId`: the id of the participant.

##### PARTICIPANT_LEFT

Called when a participant has left the conference. `data` contains the following information:

- `participantId`: the id of the participant that left.

##### ENDPOINT_TEXT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED

Broadcasted when an endpoint text message is received. The `data` HashMap contains a `senderId` key with the
participantId of the sender and a `message` key with the content.

#### SCREEN_SHARE_TOGGLED

Broadcasted when a participant starts or stops sharing his screen. `data` contains the following information:

- `participantId`: Id of the participant that started or stopped sharing his screen.
- `sharing`: True if the participant is sharing his screen, false otherwise.

##### PARTICIPANTS_INFO_RETRIEVED

Broadcasted when a RETRIEVE_PARTICIPANTS_INFO action is called. The `data` HashMap contains a `participantsInfo` key
with a list of participants information and a `requestId` key with the id that was sent in the
RETRIEVE_PARTICIPANTS_INFO action.

##### CHAT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED

Broadcasted when a chat text message is received. `data` contains the following information:

- `senderId`: the id of the participant that sent the message.
- `message`: the content of the message.
- `isPrivate`: true if the message is private, false otherwise.
- `timestamp`: the (optional) timestamp of the message.

##### CHAT_TOGGLED

Broadcasted when the chat dialog is opened or closed. `data` contains the following information:

- `isOpen`: true if the chat dialog is open, false otherwise.

##### VIDEO_MUTED_CHANGED

Broadcasted when the local participant's video is muted or unmuted. `data` contains the following information:

- `muted`: an integer indicating whether the video is muted or not. 0 means unmuted, 4 means muted.

##### READY_TO_CLOSE

The SDK is ready to be closed / dismised.

### Broadcasting Actions

The SDK listens for broadcasted actions from the users and reacts accordingly.

```java
    Intent muteBroadcastIntent = new Intent(BroadcastAction.Type.SET_AUDIO_MUTED.getAction());
    muteBroadcastIntent.putExtra("muted", muted);
    LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).sendBroadcast(muteBroadcastIntent);
 ```

The intents can be build manually (as shown above) or through the methods in `BroadcastIntentHelper`.

Please see `JitsiMeetOngoingConferenceService` for more examples of sending actions.

#### Supported actions

##### SET_AUDIO_MUTED
Sets the state of the localParticipant audio muted according to the `muted` parameter.
Expects a `muted` key on the intent extra with a boolean value.

##### SET_VIDEO_MUTED
Sets the state of the localParticipant video muted according to the `muted` parameter.
Expects a `muted` key on the intent extra with a boolean value.

##### HANG_UP
The localParticipant leaves the current conference.
Does not expect any extra value.

##### SEND_ENDPOINT_TEXT_MESSAGE
Sends a message via the data channel to one particular participant or to all of them.
Expects a `to` key on the intent extra with the id of the participant to which the message 
is meant and a `message` key with a string value, the actual content of the message. 
If the `to` key is not present or it's value is empty, the message will be sent 
to all the participants in the conference.

In order to get the participantId, the `PARTICIPANT_JOINED` event should be listened for,
which `data` includes the id and this should be stored somehow.

##### TOGGLE_SCREEN_SHARE
Sets the state of the localParticipant screen share according to the `enabled` parameter.
Expects a `enabled` key on the intent extra with a boolean value.

##### RETRIEVE_PARTICIPANTS_INFO
Signals the SDK to retrieve a list with the participants information. The SDK will emit a PARTICIPANTS_INFO_RETRIEVED event.
Expects a `requestId` key on the intent extra with a string value, this parameter will be present on the PARTICIPANTS_INFO_RETRIEVED event.

##### OPEN_CHAT
Opens the chat dialog. If a `to` key is present with a valid participantId, the private chat for that particular participant will be opened.

##### CLOSE_CHAT
Closes the chat dialog.
Does not expect any extra value.

##### SEND_CHAT_MESSAGE
Sends a chat message, either a private one if a `to` key is present with a valid participantId and to everybody otherwise.
Expects a `message` key with a string value.

## ProGuard rules

When using the SDK on a project some proguard rules have to be added in order
to avoid necessary code being stripped. Add the following to your project's
rules file: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/android/app/proguard-rules.pro

## Picture-in-Picture

`JitsiMeetView` will automatically adjust its UI when presented in a
Picture-in-Picture style scenario, in a rectangle too small to accommodate its
"full" UI.

## Dropbox integration

To setup the Dropbox integration, follow these steps:

1. Add the following to the app's AndroidManifest.xml and change `<APP_KEY>` to
your Dropbox app key:
```
<activity
    android:configChanges="keyboard|orientation"
    android:launchMode="singleTask"
    android:name="com.dropbox.core.android.AuthActivity">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <data android:scheme="db-<APP_KEY>" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

2. Add the following to the app's strings.xml and change `<APP_KEY>` to your
Dropbox app key:
```
<string name="dropbox_app_key"><APP_KEY></string>
```
