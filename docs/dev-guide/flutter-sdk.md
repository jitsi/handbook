The Jitsi Meet Flutter SDK provides the same user experience as the Jitsi Meet app,
in form of a Flutter plugin so that you can embed and customize Jitsi Meet in your own Flutter app.

## Sample application using the Flutter 

If you want to see how easy integrating the Jitsi Meet Flutter SDK into a Flutter application is, take a look at the<br/>
[sample applications repository](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-sdk-samples/flutter).

## Installation

### Add dependency

Add this to the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project:

```yaml
dependencies:
    jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk: '^0.1.2'
```

### Install 

Install the packages from the terminal:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

### Import files

Import the following files into your dart code:

```dart
import 'package:jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk/jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk.dart';
```

### Usage

#### Join meeting

Firstly, create a `JitsiMeet` object, then call the method `join` from it with a `JitsiMeetConferenceOptions` object

```dart
var jitsiMeet = JitsiMeet();
var options = JitsiMeetConferenceOptions(room: 'jitsiIsAwesome');
jitsiMeet.join(options);
```

## Configuration

### iOS

Make sure in `Podfile` from `ios` directory you set the ios version `12.4 or higher` 

```
platform :ios, '12.4'
```

The plugin requests camera and microphone access, make sure to include the required entries for `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` file from the `ios/Runner` directory.

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs access to your camera for meetings.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs access to your microphone for meetings.</string>
```

### Android

Go to `android/app/build.gradle` and make sure that the `minSdkVersion` is set to `at lest 24`

```
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 24
    }
}
```


The `application:label` field from the Jitsi Meet Android SDK will conflict with your application's one . Go to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the tools library and `tools:replace="android:label"` to the application tag.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" 
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
    <application
        tools:replace="android:label"
        android:label="sample_app"
        android:name="${applicationName}"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```
## Using the API

### JitsiMeet

The `JitsiMeet` class is the entry point for the sdk. It is used to launch the meeting screen and to send all the events.

1. ####  JitsiMeet()
    The constructor for the class.


2. ####  join(JitsiMeetConferenceOptions options, [JitsiMeetEventListener? listener])
    Joins a meeting with the given options and optionally a listener is given

    - `options` : meeting options
    - `listener` : event listener for events triggered by the native sdks

3. #### hangUp()

    The localParticipant leaves the current meeting.

4. #### setAudioMuted(bool muted)

    Sets the state of the localParticipant audio muted according to the `muted` parameter.

5. #### setVideoMuted(bool muted)
    Sets the state of the localParticipant video muted according to the `muted` parameter.

6. #### sendEndpointTextMessage({String? to, required String message})
    Sends a message via the data channel to one particular participant or to all of them. If the `to` param is empty, the message will be sent to all the participants in the conference.

    In order to get the participantId, the `participantsJoined` event should be listened for, which have as a parameter the `participantId` and this should be stored somehow.

7. #### toggleScreenShare(bool enabled)

    Sets the state of the localParticipant screen sharing according to the `enabled` parameter.

8. #### openChat([String? to])

    Opens the chat dialog. If `to` contains a valid participantId, the private chat with that particular participant will be opened.

9. #### sendChatMessage({String? to, required String message})

    Sends a chat message via to one particular participant or to all of them. If the `to` param is empty, the message will be sent to all the participants in the conference.

    In order to get the participantId, the `participantsJoined` event should be listened for, which have as a parameter the `participantId` and this should be stored somehow.√ç

10. #### closeChat()

    Closes the chat dialog.

11. #### retrieveParticipantsInfo()

    Sends and event that will trigger the `participantsInfoRetrieved` events which will contain participants information


### JitsiMeetConferenceOptions

This object encapsulates all the options that can be tweaked when joining a conference.

Example:

```dart
var options = JitsiMeetConferenceOptions(
      serverURL: "https://meet.jit.si",
      room: "jitsiIsAwesomeWithFlutter",
      configOverrides: {
        "startWithAudioMuted": false,
        "startWithVideoMuted": false,
