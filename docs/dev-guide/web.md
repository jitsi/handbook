Welcome to the developers guide for web! This guide will help you setup a development
environment to start working on the Jitsi Meet applications.

:::caution
Building the apps / SDKs is not supported on Windows.
:::

## Building the sources

:::note
Node.js >= 12 and npm >= 6 are required.
:::

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, the required packages can be installed with:
- Download "Linux Binaries (x64)" from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Install Node.js following these instructions: https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation

Then go ahead:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet
cd ./jitsi-meet

npm install

# To build the Jitsi Meet application, just type
make
```

### Running with webpack-dev-server for development

Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make dev
```

By default the backend deployment used is `alpha.jitsi.net`. You can point the Jitsi Meet app at a different backend by using a proxy server. To do this, set the WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_PROXY_TARGET variable:

```bash
export WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_PROXY_TARGET=https://your-example-server.com
make dev
```

The app should be running at https://localhost:8080/

#### Certificate Error

Browsers may show a certificate error since the development certificate is self-signed. It's safe to disregard those
warning and continue to your site.

### Building .debs

To make a deb you can easily deploy to a public test server, ensure you have the lib-jitsi-meet sources you wish, then:
```
npm install
make
dpkg-buildpackage -A -rfakeroot -us -uc -tc
```

You'll have a bunch of .deb files in the parent directory, and can push the updated source to your server and install it with the jitsi-meet-web deb file.

### Running from source on existing deployment
