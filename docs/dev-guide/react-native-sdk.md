The Jitsi React Native SDK provides the same user experience as the Jitsi Meet app,
in a customizable way which you can embed in your React Native apps.

## Sample application using the React Native SDK

If you want to see how easy integrating the Jitsi React Native SDK into a React Native application is, take a look at the<br/>
[sample applications repository](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-sdk-samples#react-native).

## Usage

While this is a published library, you can `npm i @jitsi/react-native-sdk`.<br/>
Dependency conflicts may occur between RNSDK and your app. <br/>If that is the case, please run `npm i @jitsi/react-native-sdk --force`.<br/>
To check if some dependencies need to be added, please run the following script `node node_modules/@jitsi/react-native-sdk/update_dependencies.js`.<br/>
This will sync all of our peer dependencies with your dependencies. <br/>
Next you will need to do `npm install`.

Because our SDK uses SVG files, you will need to update your metro bundler configuration accordingly:

```config title="metro.config"
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('metro-config');

module.exports = (async () => {
  const {
    resolver: {
      sourceExts,
      assetExts
    }
  } = await getDefaultConfig();

  return {
    transformer: {
      babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('react-native-svg-transformer'),
      getTransformOptions: async () => ({
        transform: {
          experimentalImportSupport: false,
          inlineRequires: true,
        },
      }),
    },
    resolver: {
      assetExts: assetExts.filter(ext => ext !== 'svg'),
      sourceExts: [...sourceExts, 'svg']
    }
  }
})();
```


### Android

#### Permissions
- In `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml` and `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, under the `</application>` tag, please include
  ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MANAGE_OWN_CALLS" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
  ```
- Starting Android 14, specific foreground service types permissions require to be added in the manifest file: 
  ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION" />
  ```

#### Services
- To enables the screen share feature you now need to go to your `MainApplication.java` file and:
  1. `import com.oney.WebRTCModule.WebRTCModuleOptions;` that comes from `react-native-webrtc` dependency.
  
  2. `WebRTCModuleOptions options = WebRTCModuleOptions.getInstance();` instance it.
  3. `options.enableMediaProjectionService = true;` enable foreground service that takes care of screen-sharing feature.

#### API
- Our app use `react-native-orientation-locker` dependency that uses API 33 features. Make sure that your app, in `android\build.gradle`, targets, at least, that version:
  ```markdown
    buildscript {
        ext {
            compileSdkVersion = 33
            targetSdkVersion = 33
        }
    }
  ```

### iOS 

#### Permissions
- React Native SDK requests camera and microphone access, make sure to include the required entries for `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`in your `Info.plist` file.
- React Native SDK shows and hides the status bar based on the conference state,
  you may want to set `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` to `NO` in your
  `Info.plist` file.
- For starting screen sharing React Native SDK provides the UI to present the `RPSystemBroadcastPickerView` to the user. By default, the picker will display a list of all the available broadcast providers. In order to limit the picker to our particular broadcast provider, we have to set `preferredExtension` to the bundle identifier of the broadcast extension. We are doing this by adding a new key named `RTCScreenSharingExtension` to the app's Info.plist and setting the broadcast extension bundle identifier as the value.
- Make sure `voip` is added to `UIBackgroundModes`, in the app's `Info.plist`, in order to work when the app is in the background.
 

#### Build Phases

##### Run Script Phases
- For the sounds to work, please add the following script in Xcode:
  ```shell
    SOUNDS_DIR="${PROJECT_DIR}/../node_modules/@jitsi/react-native-sdk/sounds"
    cp $SOUNDS_DIR/* ${CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR}/${UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH}/
  ```
