This is The Jitsi Meet Handbook, your one-stop-shop for Jitsi documentation. It's powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Building the site

The site is built automatiaclly with every push thanks to a [GH Action](https://github.com/jitsi/handbook/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml).

If you want to build it locally, follow these simple steps:

```js
cd website
npm install
npm start
```

You can now edit the files in the `docs` folder and the site will reflect the changes immediately thanks to
live reloading.
